zmq_close(3)
============


NAME
----
zmq_close - close 0MQ socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_close (void '*socket');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_close()_ function shall destroy the socket referenced by the 'socket'
argument. Any outstanding messages physically received from the network but not
yet received by the application with _zmq_recv()_ shall be discarded. The
behaviour for discarding messages sent by the application with _zmq_send()_ but
not yet physically transferred to the network depends on the value of the
_ZMQ_LINGER_ socket option for the specified 'socket'.

NOTE: The default setting of _ZMQ_LINGER_ does not discard unsent messages;
this behaviour may cause the application to block when calling _zmq_term()_.
For details refer to link:zmq_setsockopt.html[zmq_setsockopt] and link:zmq_term.html[zmq_term].


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_close()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall
return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*ENOTSOCK*::
The provided 'socket' was invalid.
