zmq_ctx_destroy(3)
==================


NAME
----
zmq_ctx_destroy - terminate a 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_ctx_destroy (void '*context');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_ctx_destroy()_ function shall destroy the 0MQ context 'context'.

Context termination is performed in the following steps:

1. Any blocking operations currently in progress on sockets open within
   'context' shall return immediately with an error code of ETERM.  With the
   exception of _zmq_close()_, any further operations on sockets open within
   'context' shall fail with an error code of ETERM.

2. After interrupting all blocking calls, _zmq_ctx_destroy()_ shall _block_ until the
   following conditions are satisfied:

   * All sockets open within 'context' have been closed with _zmq_close()_.

   * For each socket within 'context', all messages sent by the application
     with _zmq_send()_ have either been physically transferred to a network
     peer, or the socket's linger period set with the _ZMQ_LINGER_ socket
     option has expired.

For further details regarding socket linger behavior refer to the _ZMQ_LINGER_
option in linkzmq:zmq_setsockopt[3].

This function is deprecated by linkzmq:zmq_ctx_term[3].


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_ctx_destroy()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise
it shall return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The provided 'context' was invalid.
*EINTR*::
Termination was interrupted by a signal. It can be restarted if needed.
