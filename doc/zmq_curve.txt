NAME
----
zmq_curve - secure authentication and confidentiality


SYNOPSIS
--------
The CURVE mechanism defines a mechanism for secure authentication and 
confidentiality for communications between a client and a server. CURVE 
is intended for use on public networks. The CURVE mechanism is defined 
by this document: <http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25>.


CLIENT AND SERVER ROLES
-----------------------
A socket using CURVE can be either client or server but not both. The role
is independent of bind/connect direction.

To become a CURVE server, the application sets the ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER option
on the socket, and then sets the ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY option to provide the
socket with its long-term secret key. The application does not provide the
socket with its long-term public key, which is used only by clients.

To become a CURVE client, the application sets the ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY 
option with the long-term public key of the server it intends to connect
to. A CURVE client can connect to (or accept connections from) at most
one CURVE server. The application then sets the ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY and
ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY options with its client long-term key pair.

If the server does authentication it will be based on the client's long
term public key.

TEST KEY VALUES
---------------

For test cases, the client shall use this long-term key pair:

----
public: BB88471D65E2659B30C55A5321CEBB5AAB2B70A398645C26DCA2B2FCB43FC518
secret: 7BB864B489AFA3671FBE69101F94B38972F24816DFB01B51656B3FEC8DFD0888
----

And the server shall use this long-term key pair:

----
public: 54FCBA24E93249969316FB617C872BB0C1D1FF14800427C594CBFACF1BC2D652
secret: 8E0BDD697628B91D8F245587EE95C5B04D48963F79259877B49CD9063AEAD3B7
