zmq_disconnect(3)
=================


NAME
----
zmq_disconnect - Disconnect a socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_disconnect (void '*socket', const char '*endpoint');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_disconnect()_ function shall disconnect a socket specified
by the 'socket' argument from the endpoint specified by the 'endpoint'
argument. Any outstanding messages physically received from the network but not
yet received by the application with _zmq_recv()_ shall be discarded. The
behaviour for discarding messages sent by the application with _zmq_send()_ but
not yet physically transferred to the network depends on the value of the
_ZMQ_LINGER_ socket option for the specified 'socket'.

The 'endpoint' argument is as described in linkzmq:zmq_connect[3]

NOTE: The default setting of _ZMQ_LINGER_ does not discard unsent messages;
this behaviour may cause the application to block when calling _zmq_term()_.
For details refer to linkzmq:zmq_setsockopt[3] and linkzmq:zmq_term[3].


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_disconnect()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it
shall return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.

ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The endpoint supplied is invalid.
*ETERM*::
The 0MQ 'context' associated with the specified 'socket' was terminated.
*ENOTSOCK*::
The provided 'socket' was invalid.
*ENOENT*::
The provided endpoint is not connected.


EXAMPLE
-------
.Connecting a subscriber socket to an in-process and a TCP transport
----
/* Create a ZMQ_SUB socket */
void *socket = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_SUB);
assert (socket);
/* Connect it to the host server001, port 5555 using a TCP transport */
rc = zmq_connect (socket, "tcp://server001:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
/* Disconnect from the previously connected endpoint */
rc = zmq_disconnect (socket, "tcp://server001:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
