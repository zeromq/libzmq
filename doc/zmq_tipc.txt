NAME
----
zmq_tipc - 0MQ unicast transport using TIPC


SYNOPSIS
--------
TIPC is a cluster IPC protocol with a location transparent addressing scheme.


ADDRESSING
----------
A 0MQ endpoint is a string consisting of a 'transport'`://` followed by an
'address'. The 'transport' specifies the underlying protocol to use. The
'address' specifies the transport-specific address to connect to.

For the TIPC transport, the transport is `tipc`, and the meaning of the
'address' part is defined below.


Assigning a port name to a socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When assigning a port name to a socket using _zmq_bind()_ with the 'tipc'
transport, the 'endpoint' is defined in the form:
{type, lower, upper}

* Type is the numerical (u32) ID of your service.
* Lower and Upper specify a range for your service.

Publishing the same service with overlapping lower/upper ID's will
cause connection requests to be distributed over these in a round-robin
manner.


Connecting a socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When connecting a socket to a peer address using _zmq_connect()_ with the 'tipc'
transport, the 'endpoint' shall be interpreted as a service ID, followed by a 
comma and the instance ID.

The instance ID must be within the lower/upper range of a published port name
for the endpoint to be valid.

EXAMPLES
--------
.Assigning a local address to a socket
----
//  Publish TIPC service ID 5555
rc = zmq_bind(socket, "tipc://{5555,0,0}");
assert (rc == 0);
//  Publish TIPC service ID 5555 with a service range of 0-100
rc = zmq_bind(socket, "tipc://{5555,0,100}");
assert (rc == 0);
----

.Connecting a socket
----
//  Connect to service 5555 instance id 50
rc = zmq_connect(socket, "tipc://{5555,50}");
assert (rc == 0);
