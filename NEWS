0MQ version 4.0.1 stable, released on 2013/10/08
================================================

Changes
-------

* Updated CURVE mechanism to track revised RFC 27 (INITIATE vouch).

  The INITIATE command vouch box is Box[C',S](C->S') instead of
  Box[C'](C->S), to reduce the risk of client impersonation, as per
  https://codesinchaos.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/curvecp-1/.

* Fixed LIBZMQ-567, adding abstract namespaces for IPC sockets on Linux.

  Converts an initial strudel or "at sign" (@) in the Unix socket path to
  a NULL character ('\0') indicating that the socket uses the abstract
  namespace instead of the filesystem namespace.  For instance, binding a
  socket to 'ipc://@/tmp/tester' will not create a file associated with
  the socket whereas binding to 'ipc:///tmp/tester' will create the file
  /tmp/tester. See issue 567 for more information.

* Added zmq_z85_encode and zmq_z85_decode to core libzmq API.

* Added zmq_curve_keypair to core libzmq API.

* Bumped library ABI version to 4:0:1.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed some build/test errors on OS/X + Clang++.

* Fixed LIBZMQ-565, typo in code.

* Fixed LIBZMQ-566, dealer-to-router connections sometimes failing.

* Fixed builds for AIX, MSVC 2008, OS/X with clang++, Solaris.

* Improved CURVE handshake error handling.


0MQ version 4.0.0 (RC1), released on 2013/09/20
===============================================

Major changes
-------------

* New wire level protocol, ZMTP/3.0, see http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23.
  Does not yet implement the SUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, PING, and PONG commands.
  
* New security framework, from plain user+password to strong encryption, 
  see section below. See http://hintjens.com/blog:49 for a tutorial.
  
* New ZMQ_STREAM socket type for working as a TCP client or server. See: 
  tests/test_stream.cpp.
  
Improvements
------------

* You can now connect to an inproc:// endpoint that does not already
  exist. This means inproc:// no longer needs careful set-up, but it may
  break code that relied on the old behaviour. See: 
  tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
 
* Libzmq now checks socket types at connection time, so that trying to 
  connect a 'wrong' socket type will fail.
  
* New zmq_ctx_shutdown API method will shutdown a context and send ETERM
  to blocking calls, without blocking. Use zmq_ctx_term to finalise the
  process.
  
* The regression test suite has been significantly extended and improved.
  
* Contexts can now be terminated in forked child processes. See: 
  tests/test_fork.cpp.
  
* zmq_disconnect now respects the linger setting on sockets.

* New zmq_send_const API method to send constant data (without copying).
  See: tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
  
* Added CMake support for static libraries.

* Added test cases for socket semantics as defined in RFCs 28, 29, 30, 31.
  See: tests/test_spec_*.cpp.

* New socket option, ZMQ_PROBE_ROUTER triggers an empty message on connect.
  See: tests/test_probe_router.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZMQ_REQ_CORRELATE allows for correlation of replies 
  from a REP socket. See: tests/test_req_correlate.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZMQ_REQ_RELAXED, lets you disable the state machine 
  on a REQ socket, so you can send multiple requests without waiting for 
  replies, and without getting an EFSM error. See: 
  tests/test_req_relaxed.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZMQ_CONFLATE restricts the outgoing and incoming 
  socket buffers to a single message. See: tests/test_conflate.cpp.

Deprecated Options
------------------

* ZMQ_IPV4ONLY deprecated and renamed to ZMQ_IPV6 so that options are
  consistently "off" by default. 

* ZMQ_DELAY_ATTACH_ON_CONNECT deprecated, and renamed to ZMQ_IMMEDIATE.
  See: tests/test_immediate.cpp.

Security Framework
------------------

Based on new ZMTP wire level protocol that negotiates a security 
"mechanism" between client and server before exchanging any other data.

Security mechanisms are extensible. ZMTP defines three by default:

* NULL - classic ZeroMQ, with no authentication. See 
  http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23.
  
* PLAIN - plain-text username + password authentication. See
  http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:24.

* CURVE - secure authentication and encryption based on elliptic curve 
  cryptography, using the Curve25519 algorithm from Daniel Bernstein and 
  based on CurveCP's security handshake. See http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25, 
  http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26, and http://curvecp.org.
  
Authentication is done by pluggable "authenticators" that connect to libzmq
over an inproc endpoint, see http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27.

Socket options to configure PLAIN security on client or server:

* ZMQ_PLAIN_SERVER, ZMQ_PLAIN_USERNAME, ZMQ_PLAIN_PASSWORD. See 
  tests/test_security_plain.
  
Socket options to configure CURVE security on client or server:

* ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER, ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY, ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY, 
  ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY. See tests/test_security_curve.cpp.
  
Socket options to configure "domain" for ZAP handler:
 
* ZMQ_ZAP_DOMAIN, see tests/test_security_null.cpp.

Support for encoding/decoding CURVE binary keys to ASCII:

* zmq_z85_encode, zmq_z85_decode.

OMQ version 3.1.0 (beta), released on 2011/12/18
================================================

General information
-------------------

Based on community consensus, the 0MQ 3.1.x release reverts a number of
features introduced in version 3.0. The major reason for these changes is
improving backward compatibility with 0MQ 2.1.x.

Development of the 0MQ 3.0.x series will be discontinued, and users are
encouraged to upgrade to 3.1.

The 0MQ 3.1.x releases use ABI version 3.

Reverted functionality
----------------------

The following functionality present in 0MQ 3.0 has been reverted:

* Wire format changes. The 0MQ 3.1 wire format is identical to that of 0MQ
  2.1.

* LABELs and COMMANDs have been removed.

* Explicit identies are re-introduced, however they can be used only for
  explicit routing, not for durable sockets.

* The ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER socket types are once again aliases for
  ZMQ_XREQ and ZMQ_XREP.

New functionality
-----------------

* The zmq_getmsgopt() function has been introduced.

* Experimental IPv6 support has been introduced. This is disabled by
  default, see the zmq_setsockopt() documentation for enabling it.

Other changes
-------------

* The default HWM for all socket types has been set to 1000.

* Many bug fixes.

Building
--------

* The dependency on libuuid has been removed.

* Support for building on Android, and with MSVC 10 has been added.

0MQ version 3.0.0 (alpha), released on 2011/07/12
=================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* A zmq_ctx_set_monitor() API to register a callback / event sink for changes
  in socket state.

* POSIX-compliant zmq_send and zmq_recv introduced (uses raw buffer
  instead of message object).

* ZMQ_MULTICAST_HOPS socket option added. Sets the appropriate field in
  IP headers of PGM packets.

* Subscription forwarding. Instead of filtering on consumer, the
  subscription is moved as far as possible towards the publisher and
  filtering is done there.

* ZMQ_XPUB, ZMQ_XSUB introduced. Allow to create subscription-
  forwarding-friendly intermediate devices.

* Add sockopt ZMQ_RCVTIMEO/ZMQ_SNDTIMEO. Allow to set timeout for
  blocking send/recv calls.

* A new LABEL flag was added to the wire format. The flag distinguishes
  message parts used by 0MQ (labels) from user payload message parts.

* There is a new wire format for the REQ/REP pattern. First, the empty
  bottom-of-the-stack message part is not needed any more, the LABEL
  flag is used instead. Secondly, peer IDs are 32-bit integers rather
  than 17-byte UUIDs.

* The REQ socket now drops duplicate replies.

* Outstanding requests & replies associated with a client are dropped
  when the clients dies. This is a performance optimisation.

* Introduced ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER sockets. These mimic the
  functionality of ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER in 0MQ/2.1.x. Guarantees
  backward compatibility for exsiting code.

* Removed dependency on OS socketpair buffer size. No more asserts in
  mailbox.cpp because of low system limit of sockepair buffer size.

API improvements
----------------

* Obsolete constants ZMQ_UPSTREAM and ZMQ_DOWNSTREAM removed. Use
  ZMQ_PUSH and ZMQ_PULL instead.

* Timeout in zmq_poll is in milliseconds instead of microseconds. This
  makes zmq_poll() compliant with POSIX poll()

* ZMQ_MCAST_LOOP removed. There's no support for multicast over
  loopback any more. Use IPC or TCP isntead.

* zmq_send/zmq_recv was renamed zmq_sendmsg/zmq_recvmsg.

* ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL and ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC reconciled. The new option
  is named ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL and the unit is milliseconds.

* Option types changed. Most of the numeric types are now represented
  as 'int'.

* ZMQ_HWM split into ZMQ_SNDHWM and ZMQ_RCVHWM. This makes it possible
  to control message flow separately for each direction.

* ZMQ_NOBLOCK renamed ZMQ_DONTWAIT. That makes it POSIX-compliant.

Less is More
------------

* Pre-built devices and zmq_device() removed. Should be made available
  as a separate project(s).

* ZMQ_SWAP removed. Writing data to disk should be done on top of 0MQ,
  on inside it.

* C++ binding removed from the core. Now it's a separate project, same
  as any other binding.

Bug fixes
---------

* Many.

Building
--------

* Make pkg-config dependency conditional.

Distribution
------------

* Removed Debian packaging, which is now available at packages.debian.org
  or via apt-get.


Older versions
