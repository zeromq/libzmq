0MQ version 2.0.7 (Beta), released on 2010/06/04
================================================


Distribution
------------

* The core documentation has been updated with many clarifications, especially
  in the description of the functionality provided by the different socket
  types.

* The version of OpenPGM bundled with 0MQ has been updated to the 2.1.26 release.


Building
--------

* GCC-isms have been removed from the code and build system across the board;
  0MQ should now build with no issues when using compilers other than GCC.


Interface
---------

* The zmq_init() function now has only a single parameter; the number of 0MQ
  I/O threads to create in the context being initialised. The app_threads and
  flags parameters have been removed.

* The ZMQ_P2P socket type has been renamed to ZMQ_PAIR.

* The ZMQ_LWM socket option has been removed; the low water mark for a socket
  is now computed automatically by 0MQ.

* A zmq_getsockopt() function has been added.


New functionality
-----------------

* Multi-hop request/reply is fully supported. This feature allows the insertion
  of device(s) between ZMQ_REQ and ZMQ_REP sockets thus enabling scenarios
  such as multi-threaded server, shared service queue, and other interesting
  messaging topologies. The entire infrastructure is transparent to
  applications.

* Multi-part messages.  A 0MQ message may now be composed of 1 or more message
  parts; each message part is an independent zmq_msg_t in its own right. 0MQ
  ensures atomic delivery of messages; peers shall receive either all message
  parts of a message or none at all.

  This feature allows for seamless zero-copy message passing when data are
  scattered in memory, and is an important building block for multi-hop
  messaging topologies.

* Context termination and ETERM. The zmq_term() function has been
  changed to interrupt any blocking operations on open sockets, causing them to
  return the newly defined ETERM error code. This allows for orderly
  application termination, especially when multiple application threads are
  involved.


0MQ version 2.0.6 (Beta), released on 2010/03/16
================================================


Distribution
------------

* The 0MQ core distribution has been slimmed down to include only the core
  C library and C++ language binding. Pointers to other language bindings can
  be found on the website. Examples have also been removed from the
  core and can be found elsewhere. Performance tests specific to a language
  binding can be found bundled with that language binding.

* The 0MQ reference manual supplied with the distribution has been
  extensively rewritten, and is now provided in HTML as well as UNIX
  manpage format.

* Commencing with this release, a 0MQ version numbering scheme has been
  introduced. The numbering scheme used is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The "Beta" or
  "Stable" label is informative only and does not constitute
  part of the library version number, therefore this release is numbered
  2.0.6 as the sixth release of 2.0.

* The version of OpenPGM bundled with 0MQ has been updated to the stable
  2.0.24 release.


Building
--------

* Many portability fixes, including support for new platforms: FreeBSD, 
  NetBSD, HP-UX and Cygwin.

* Invocation of configure has been simplified, all functionality is now
  built by default with the exception of OpenPGM.


Interface
---------

* The udp transport has been renamed to epgm to avoid confusion with
  unreliable unicast.

* A ZMQ_POLLERR constant has been added to allow for polling on errors on
  Berkeley sockets with zmq_poll().

* The zmq_version() function has been introduced and returns the version
  number of the 0MQ library.

* The zmq_flush() function and ZMQ_NOFLUSH flag of zmq_send() have been
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release.


Wire format
-----------

* The 0MQ wire format has been changed. A flags field has been added to
  allow for future extensions.


New functionality
-----------------

* The experimental ZMQ_P2P socket type has been implemented.

* Flow control has been implemented for all socket types. For details see
  the ZMQ_HWM and ZMQ_LWM socket options.

* Subscription filters are internally matched with O(1) complexity.


Licensing
---------

* iMatix corporation has granted the following exception regarding static
  linking with the 0MQ library:

    As a special exception, iMatix gives you permission to link this
    library with independent modules to produce an executable,
    regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and
    to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of
    your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of
    that module. An independent module is a module which is not
    derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this
    library, you must extend this exception to your version of the
    library.
