0MQ version 4.2.0 stable, released on 2016/11/04
=============================================

* For Pieter. Thanks for making all of this possible.

  "Tell them I was a writer.
   A maker of software.
   A humanist. A father.
   And many things.
   But above all, a writer.
   Thank You. :)"
   - Pieter Hintjens

* This release introduces new APIs, but it is ABI compatible with
  libzmq 4.1.2 and up.

* Note for ARM and SPARC users: an alignment problem in zmq_msg_t that could in
  some cases and on some CPUs cause a SIGBUS error was solved, but it requires
  a rebuild of your application against the 4.2.0 version of include/zmq.h.
  To clarify, this change does not affect the internals of the library but only
  the public definition of zmq_msg_t, so there is no ABI incompatibility.

* Security with Curve is now available by default thanks to Tweetnacl sources:
  https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/index.html
  Libsodium is still fully supported but has to be enabled with the build flag
  --with-libsodium. Distribution and package maintainers are encouraged to use
  libsodium so that the security implementation can be audited and maintained
  separately.

* New Context options:
  - ZMQ_MAX_MSGSZ
  See doc/zmq_ctx_set.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt for details.

* New Socket options:
  - ZMQ_HANDSHAKE_IVL
  - ZMQ_SOCKS_PROXY
  - ZMQ_XPUB_NODROP
  - ZMQ_BLOCKY
  - ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL
  - ZMQ_XPUB_WELCOME_MSG
  - ZMQ_STREAM_NOTIFY
  - ZMQ_INVERT_MATCHING
  - ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL
  - ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TTL
  - ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT
  - ZMQ_XPUB_VERBOSER
  - ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
  - ZMQ_TCP_MAXRT
  - ZMQ_THREAD_SAFE
  - ZMQ_MULTICAST_MAXTPDU
  - ZMQ_VMCI_BUFFER_SIZE
  - ZMQ_VMCI_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE
  - ZMQ_VMCI_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE
  - ZMQ_VMCI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
  - ZMQ_USE_FD
  See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.

* New CURVE helper function to derive z85 public key from secret key:
    zmq_curve_public

* New cross-platform atomic counter helper functions:
    zmq_atomic_counter_new, zmq_atomic_counter_set, zmq_atomic_counter_inc,
    zmq_atomic_counter_dec, zmq_atomic_counter_value, zmq_atomic_counter_destroy
  See doc/zmq_atomic_*.txt for details.

* New DRAFT APIs early-release mechanism. New APIs will be introduced early
  in public releases, and until they are stabilized and guaranteed not to
  change anymore they will be unavailable unless the new build flag
  --enable-drafts is used. This will allow developers and early adopters to
  test new APIs before they are finalized.
  NOTE: as the name implies, NO GUARANTEE is made on the stability of these APIs.
  They might change or disappear entirely. Distributions are recommended NOT to
  build with them.

  New socket types have been introduced in DRAFT state:
    ZMQ_SERVER, ZMQ_CLIENT, ZMQ_RADIO, ZMQ_DISH, ZMQ_GATHER, ZMQ_SCATTER,
    ZMQ_DGRAM
  All these sockets are THREAD SAFE, unlike the existing socket types. They do
  NOT support multipart messages (ZMQ_SNDMORE/ZMQ_RCVMORE).
  All these sockets minus ZMQ_SERVER and ZMQ_CLIENT also support UDP as transport.
  New methods to support the new socket types functionality:
    zmq_join, zmq_leave, zmq_msg_set_routing_id, zmq_msg_routing_id,
    zmq_msg_set_group, zmq_msg_group
  See doc/zmq_socket.txt for more details.

  New poller mechanism and APIs have been introduced in DRAFT state:
    zmq_poller_new, zmq_poller_destroy, zmq_poller_add, zmq_poller_modify,
    zmq_poller_remove, zmq_poller_wait, zmq_poller_wait_all, zmq_poller_add_fd
    zmq_poller_modify_fd, zmq_poller_remove_fd
  and a new supporting struct typedef: zmq_poller_event_t
  They support existing socket type, new thread-safe socket types and file
  descriptors (cross-platform).
  Documentation will be made available in the future before these APIs are declared
  stable.

  New cross-platform timers helper functions have been introduced in DRAFT state:
    zmq_timers_new, zmq_timers_destroy, zmq_timers_add, zmq_timers_cancel,
    zmq_timers_set_interval, zmq_timers_reset, zmq_timers_timeout,
    zmq_timers_execute
  and a new supporting callback typedef: zmq_timer_fn

* Many, many bug fixes. The most important fixes are backported and captured in the
  4.1.x and 4.0.x changelogs.

0MQ version 4.0.1 stable, released on 2013/10/08
================================================

Changes
-------

* Updated CURVE mechanism to track revised RFC 27 (INITIATE vouch).

  The INITIATE command vouch box is Box[C',S](C->S') instead of
  Box[C'](C->S), to reduce the risk of client impersonation, as per
  https://codesinchaos.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/curvecp-1/.

* Fixed LIBZMQ-567, adding abstract namespaces for IPC sockets on Linux.

  Converts an initial strudel or "at sign" (@) in the Unix socket path to
  a NULL character ('\0') indicating that the socket uses the abstract
  namespace instead of the filesystem namespace.  For instance, binding a
  socket to 'ipc://@/tmp/tester' will not create a file associated with
  the socket whereas binding to 'ipc:///tmp/tester' will create the file
  /tmp/tester. See issue 567 for more information.

* Added zmq_z85_encode and zmq_z85_decode to core libzmq API.

* Added zmq_curve_keypair to core libzmq API.

* Bumped library ABI version to 4:0:1.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed some build/test errors on OS/X + Clang++.

* Fixed LIBZMQ-565, typo in code.

* Fixed LIBZMQ-566, dealer-to-router connections sometimes failing.

* Fixed builds for AIX, MSVC 2008, OS/X with clang++, Solaris.

* Improved CURVE handshake error handling.


0MQ version 4.0.0 (RC1), released on 2013/09/20
===============================================

Major changes
-------------

* New wire level protocol, ZMTP/3.0, see http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23.
  Does not yet implement the SUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, PING, and PONG commands.
  
* New security framework, from plain user+password to strong encryption, 
  see section below. See http://hintjens.com/blog:49 for a tutorial.
  
* New ZMQ_STREAM socket type for working as a TCP client or server. See: 
  tests/test_stream.cpp.
  
Improvements
------------

* You can now connect to an inproc:// endpoint that does not already
  exist. This means inproc:// no longer needs careful set-up, but it may
  break code that relied on the old behaviour. See: 
  tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
 
* Libzmq now checks socket types at connection time, so that trying to 
  connect a 'wrong' socket type will fail.
  
* New zmq_ctx_shutdown API method will shutdown a context and send ETERM
  to blocking calls, without blocking. Use zmq_ctx_term to finalise the
  process.
  
* The regression test suite has been significantly extended and improved.
  
* Contexts can now be terminated in forked child processes. See: 
  tests/test_fork.cpp.
  
* zmq_disconnect now respects the linger setting on sockets.

* New zmq_send_const API method to send constant data (without copying).
  See: tests/test_inproc_connect.cpp.
  
* Added CMake support for static libraries.

* Added test cases for socket semantics as defined in RFCs 28, 29, 30, 31.
  See: tests/test_spec_*.cpp.

* New socket option, ZMQ_PROBE_ROUTER triggers an empty message on connect.
  See: tests/test_probe_router.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZMQ_REQ_CORRELATE allows for correlation of replies 
  from a REP socket. See: tests/test_req_correlate.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZMQ_REQ_RELAXED, lets you disable the state machine 
  on a REQ socket, so you can send multiple requests without waiting for 
  replies, and without getting an EFSM error. See: 
  tests/test_req_relaxed.cpp.
  
* New socket option, ZMQ_CONFLATE restricts the outgoing and incoming 
  socket buffers to a single message. See: tests/test_conflate.cpp.

Deprecated Options
------------------

* ZMQ_IPV4ONLY deprecated and renamed to ZMQ_IPV6 so that options are
  consistently "off" by default. 

* ZMQ_DELAY_ATTACH_ON_CONNECT deprecated, and renamed to ZMQ_IMMEDIATE.
  See: tests/test_immediate.cpp.

Security Framework
------------------

Based on new ZMTP wire level protocol that negotiates a security 
"mechanism" between client and server before exchanging any other data.

Security mechanisms are extensible. ZMTP defines three by default:

* NULL - classic ZeroMQ, with no authentication. See 
  http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23.
  
* PLAIN - plain-text username + password authentication. See
  http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:24.

* CURVE - secure authentication and encryption based on elliptic curve 
  cryptography, using the Curve25519 algorithm from Daniel Bernstein and 
  based on CurveCP's security handshake. See http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25, 
  http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26, and http://curvecp.org.
  
Authentication is done by pluggable "authenticators" that connect to libzmq
over an inproc endpoint, see http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27.

Socket options to configure PLAIN security on client or server:

* ZMQ_PLAIN_SERVER, ZMQ_PLAIN_USERNAME, ZMQ_PLAIN_PASSWORD. See 
  tests/test_security_plain.
  
Socket options to configure CURVE security on client or server:

* ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER, ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY, ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY, 
  ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY. See tests/test_security_curve.cpp.
  
Socket options to configure "domain" for ZAP handler:
 
* ZMQ_ZAP_DOMAIN, see tests/test_security_null.cpp.

Support for encoding/decoding CURVE binary keys to ASCII:

* zmq_z85_encode, zmq_z85_decode.

OMQ version 3.1.0 (beta), released on 2011/12/18
================================================

General information
-------------------

Based on community consensus, the 0MQ 3.1.x release reverts a number of
features introduced in version 3.0. The major reason for these changes is
improving backward compatibility with 0MQ 2.1.x.

Development of the 0MQ 3.0.x series will be discontinued, and users are
encouraged to upgrade to 3.1.

The 0MQ 3.1.x releases use ABI version 3.

Reverted functionality
----------------------

The following functionality present in 0MQ 3.0 has been reverted:

* Wire format changes. The 0MQ 3.1 wire format is identical to that of 0MQ
  2.1.

* LABELs and COMMANDs have been removed.

* Explicit identies are re-introduced, however they can be used only for
  explicit routing, not for durable sockets.

* The ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER socket types are once again aliases for
  ZMQ_XREQ and ZMQ_XREP.

New functionality
-----------------

* The zmq_getmsgopt() function has been introduced.

* Experimental IPv6 support has been introduced. This is disabled by
  default, see the zmq_setsockopt() documentation for enabling it.

Other changes
-------------

* The default HWM for all socket types has been set to 1000.

* Many bug fixes.

Building
--------

* The dependency on libuuid has been removed.

* Support for building on Android, and with MSVC 10 has been added.

0MQ version 3.0.0 (alpha), released on 2011/07/12
=================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* A zmq_ctx_set_monitor() API to register a callback / event sink for changes
  in socket state.

* POSIX-compliant zmq_send and zmq_recv introduced (uses raw buffer
  instead of message object).

* ZMQ_MULTICAST_HOPS socket option added. Sets the appropriate field in
  IP headers of PGM packets.

* Subscription forwarding. Instead of filtering on consumer, the
  subscription is moved as far as possible towards the publisher and
  filtering is done there.

* ZMQ_XPUB, ZMQ_XSUB introduced. Allow to create subscription-
  forwarding-friendly intermediate devices.

* Add sockopt ZMQ_RCVTIMEO/ZMQ_SNDTIMEO. Allow to set timeout for
  blocking send/recv calls.

* A new LABEL flag was added to the wire format. The flag distinguishes
  message parts used by 0MQ (labels) from user payload message parts.

* There is a new wire format for the REQ/REP pattern. First, the empty
  bottom-of-the-stack message part is not needed any more, the LABEL
  flag is used instead. Secondly, peer IDs are 32-bit integers rather
  than 17-byte UUIDs.

* The REQ socket now drops duplicate replies.

* Outstanding requests & replies associated with a client are dropped
  when the clients dies. This is a performance optimisation.

* Introduced ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER sockets. These mimic the
  functionality of ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER in 0MQ/2.1.x. Guarantees
  backward compatibility for exsiting code.

* Removed dependency on OS socketpair buffer size. No more asserts in
  mailbox.cpp because of low system limit of sockepair buffer size.

API improvements
----------------

* Obsolete constants ZMQ_UPSTREAM and ZMQ_DOWNSTREAM removed. Use
  ZMQ_PUSH and ZMQ_PULL instead.

* Timeout in zmq_poll is in milliseconds instead of microseconds. This
  makes zmq_poll() compliant with POSIX poll()

* ZMQ_MCAST_LOOP removed. There's no support for multicast over
  loopback any more. Use IPC or TCP isntead.

* zmq_send/zmq_recv was renamed zmq_sendmsg/zmq_recvmsg.

* ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL and ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC reconciled. The new option
  is named ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL and the unit is milliseconds.

* Option types changed. Most of the numeric types are now represented
  as 'int'.

* ZMQ_HWM split into ZMQ_SNDHWM and ZMQ_RCVHWM. This makes it possible
  to control message flow separately for each direction.

* ZMQ_NOBLOCK renamed ZMQ_DONTWAIT. That makes it POSIX-compliant.

Less is More
------------

* Pre-built devices and zmq_device() removed. Should be made available
  as a separate project(s).

* ZMQ_SWAP removed. Writing data to disk should be done on top of 0MQ,
  on inside it.

* C++ binding removed from the core. Now it's a separate project, same
  as any other binding.

Bug fixes
---------

* Many.

Building
--------

* Make pkg-config dependency conditional.

Distribution
------------

* Removed Debian packaging, which is now available at packages.debian.org
  or via apt-get.

  if the current directory was not writeable. Behavior now is to return
  -1 at zmq_setsockopt in this situation.

* Fixed issue 207, assertion failure in zmq_connecter.cpp:48, when an
  invalid zmq_connect() string was used, or the hostname could not be

  error conditions such as EFSM properly. This bug was introduced in
  version 2.1.8 by the backport of changes for issue 231.

Building
--------

* 0MQ support for Android added (Bill Roberts, Mikko Koppanen).


0MQ version 2.1.8 (RC), released on 2011/07/28

  (bug was introduced in 2.1.6 as part of message validity checking).

* Fixed issue 211, REP socket asserted if sent malformed envelope (old issue
  due to abuse of assertions for error checking).

* Fixed issue 212, reconnect failing after resume from sleep on Windows
  (due to not handling WSAENETDOWN).

  before server binds).

* Fixed memory leak with threads on Windows.

Changes
-------

* Checks zmq_msg_t validity at each operation.

* Inproc performance tests now work on Windows.

* PGM wire format specification improved in zmq_pgm(7)

  multipart message to new subscribers (Martin Sustrik).

* Fix to PUB sockets, which would sometimes deliver tail frames of a
  multipart message to new subscribers (Martin Sustrik).

* Windows build was broken due to EPROTONOSUPPORT not being defined. This
  has now been fixed (Martin Sustrik).

* Various fixes to make OpenVMS port work (Brett Cameron).

  future upgrades of OpenPGM (Mikko Koppanen).

* Build system allows configuration with arbitrary versions of OpenPGM
  (./configure --with-pgm=libpgm-x.y.z) (Mikko Koppanen).

* OpenPGM uses new PGM_ODATA_MAX_RTE controlling original data instead of
  PGM_TXW_MAX_RTE covering entire channel (Steven McCoy).

Building
--------

* 0MQ builds properly on FreeBSD (Mikko Koppanen).


0MQ version 2.1.2 (rc2), released on 2011/03/06
===============================================

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ now correctly handles durable inproc sockets; previously it ignored
  explicit identities on inproc sockets.

* Various memory leaks were fixed.

* OpenPGM sender/receiver creation fixed.


0MQ version 2.1.1 (rc1), released on 2011/02/23
===============================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New socket option ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX added, allows for exponential
  back-off strategy when reconnecting.

* New socket option ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC added, as a fine-grained
  counterpart to ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL (for multicast transports).

* If memory is exhausted, 0MQ warns with an explicit message before
  aborting the process.

* Size of inproc HWM and SWAP is sum of peers' HWMs and SWAPs (Douglas
  Greager, Martin Sustrik).

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ no longer asserts in mailbox.cpp when multiple peers connect with
  the same identity.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when rejecting an oversized message.

* 0MQ no longer asserts in pipe.cpp when the swap fills up.

* zmq_poll now works correctly with an empty poll set.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly on CentOS, Debian 6, and SunOS/gcc3.

* Added WithOpenPGM configuration into MSVC builds.

Known issues
------------

* OpenPGM integration is still not fully stable.


0MQ version 2.1.0 (Beta), released on 2010/12/01
================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New semantics for zmq_close () and zmq_term () ensure that all messages
  are sent before the application terminates. This behaviour may be
  modified using the new ZMQ_LINGER socket option; for further details
  refer to the reference manual.

* The new socket options ZMQ_FD and ZMQ_EVENTS provide a way to integrate
  0MQ sockets into existing poll/event loops.

* Sockets may now be migrated between OS threads, as long as the
  application ensures that a full memory barrier is issued.

* The 0MQ ABI exported by libzmq.so has been formalised; DSO symbol
  visibility is used on supported platforms to ensure that only public ABI
  symbols are exported. The library ABI version has been set to 1.0.0 for
  this release.

* OpenPGM has been updated to version 5.0.92. This version no longer
  depends on GLIB, and integration with 0MQ should be much improved.

* zmq_poll() now honors timeouts precisely, and no longer returns if no
  events are signaled.

* Blocking calls now return EINTR if interrupted by the delivery of a
  signal; this also means that language bindings which previously had
  problems with handling SIGINT/^C should now work correctly.

* The ZMQ_TYPE socket option was added; this allows retrieval of the socket
  type after creation.

* Added a ZMQ_VERSION macro to zmq.h for compile-time API version
  detection.

* The ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL and ZMQ_BACKLOG socket options have been added.

Bug fixes
---------

* Forwarder and streamer devices now handle multi-part messages correctly.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when malformed data is received on the wire.

* 0MQ internal timers now work correctly if the TSC jumps backwards.

* The internal signalling functionality (mailbox) has been improved
  to automatically resize socket buffers on POSIX systems.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly with many more non-GCC compilers (Sun Studio,
  Intel ICC, CLang).

* AIX and HP-UX builds should work now.

* FD_SETSIZE has been set to 1024 by default for MSVC builds.

* Windows builds using GCC (MinGW) now work out of the box.

Distribution
------------

* A simple framework for regression tests has been added, along with a few
  basic self-tests. The tests can be run using "make check".
